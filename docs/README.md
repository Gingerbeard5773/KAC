## Why not just update doc.kag2d.com?

The main reason why this was made is so the community can contribute easily. KAG's official documentation only gets updated when there is a new test build, which isnt too bad, except the only people who can contribute to it is THD staff/interns.

Along with that, I wanted something that anybody can contribute to. If this site stops getting updates, somebody else can just fork and re-host.
