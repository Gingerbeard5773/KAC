# AngelScript

KAG uses AngelScript as its scripting langauge, and it's what you'll be using to mod the game.

## What is AngelScript?
AngelScript is a scripting langauge. There are many reasons why we may want to use a scripting langauge, the main ones being;
- Let's us update game code without needing to recompile the whole game
- Generally much easier to learn

A lot of games use a scripting langauge for this reason. There a lot of different types, one popular one being Lua, which was in consideration early development, however [we now know](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601801785623052301/716758460662022164/unknown.png) AS (AngelScript) was chosen because it was far easier to bind functions and objects then Lua.


You can read more about AngelScript [here](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/), where it will have a lot of documentation and examples on how to use it.

I plan to expand this area in the future with a guide on the basics of AngelScript at some point.
